# Super Encoder

A Intermediate Javascript project

## About

In this project my goal was to build a modular file containing encryption functions, that would be used in a user interface build to run in a node environment.

### How to use

The functions are mixed up to provide an encrypted message given the user's input, after they input the argument 'encode' when executing the program. If the output must be decoded, the user can input the former output using the 'decode' argument when executing the program.
